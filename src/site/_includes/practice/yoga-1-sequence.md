Please consider this entire sequence a meditation. Have the intention to maintain the connection with your body and your breath as you flow from one posture to the next, including the in between time. The "spaces between the notes" are just as important as the notes themselves. Remember not to push or strain while doing these poses. Apply gentle, sustained effort, allowing the muscles and joints to gently release. Use your breath, sending it into the areas of the body with which you are working. Deal with mental distractions just as you would in sitting meditation, noting them and letting them go by coming back to your body, again and again.

Namaste,
